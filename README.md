The purpose of this project is to share the code and results and code of GNN-based visual relationship detection. The code was modified from https://github.com/PhyllisH/NMP.

The code will be uploaded after our manuscript "Semantic Graph Neural Networks for Detecting Object-to-Object Visual Relationships in Complex Construction Scenes." is accepted for publication.
